# RevTap: Front-end Developer

* Create an application using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).
* Load the sample e-commerce data for `customers` and `orders` from this json [file](db.json).
* Group all the orders by `created` date field to compute orders count and total price for each day.
* Render a histogram/bar-chart to show total number of orders for each day.
* Render a line-chart to show total order price for each day.
* Render a paginated table to show the list of all customers.
* Create snapshot tests for all the components using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
* Create and share a `GitHub` repository for the application.

You can refer to [this](design.png) sample design. Feel free to use any third-party libraries to render charts and tables.
